convert the dirty bank account state csv-sheet in a clean ready to accounting calculation table

This is a Excel-VBS created to convert the csv-bank sheet in something well to work. Of course, it is a lot of belived posible configurations but here are my configurations for my bank. I don´t need the too many columns like "IBAN" or "ID" because i use this sheet only for my home accounting. I don´t need the headers with bank name o account nummer, because i have only one account there. I need my self columns names, i want to have a beatifull format, a total sum, and so on.

How it´s working?
-----------------
Download your bank sheet as csv an open this in Excel, then open the development environment. Paste the code in a VBS module. Run as a "MACRO" and ready, thats is all.

For this moment i test it only with Excel 2016, but i want to prepare a version for LibreOffice Basic.
